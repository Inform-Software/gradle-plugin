image:https://ci.jenkins.io/buildStatus/icon?job=Plugins/gradle-plugin/master[Build Status,link=https://ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/Plugins%2Fgradle-plugin/branches/]

== Description

This plugin adds http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] Support to Jenkins.
http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] is managed as another tool inside Jenkins (the same way as Ant or Maven), including support for automatic installation and a new build step is provided to execute Gradle tasks.

It also allows detecting https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] in arbitrary console logs, for Maven and Gradle builds and display them in the Jenkins UI.

In order to release this plugin have a look at link:RELEASING.md[here].

== Configuration

Gradle configuration is performed in the *Configure System* (before Jenkins 2.0) or *Global Tool Configuration* (starting in Jenkins 2.0).
In both cases these options reside in the *Manage Jenkins* section.

In the *Gradle* section provided by this plugin, several installations can be configured:

The system provides both automatic installation, which can be performed by directly downloading from the http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle web site], extracting a compressed final or executing some shell commands.
Besides, for nodes which already has Gradle installed, the tool can by manually configured, by unchecking the *Install automatically* checkbox and providing the base path (`GRADLE_HOME`) of the installation.

== Usage

The Gradle plugin provides an *Invoke Gradle script* build step.

The first configuration option is whether to use one of the installation configured in Jenkins (see previous section) of use the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] which is the Gradle-provided mechanism to "embed" the use of a specific Gradle version in a build, installing it if necessary.

Other configuration options include:

* A description to use for the build step.
* Switches (options) to provide to the Gradle execution.
* Tasks to execute (if blanck the defaults tasks of the build will be invoked).
* Path to the build script if different from the root directory of the build.
* Name of the build script if different from build.gradle.

If a https://scans.gradle.com/[Gradle Build Scan] is produced during a build, then a link to it is added to the build page.

== Capturing build scans from console log

If you are not using the provided build scan, you can still configure to detect published (Maven or Gradle) https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] from the console log.
For doing so, go to *Build Environment* and check *Inspect build log for published Gradle build scans*.

If build scans are detected in the console log of a build, a badge will be added to the build page.
This works for https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] produced by Gradle and Maven builds.

== Capturing build scans from Jenkins Pipeline

When using Jenkins pipeline, there is the step `findBuildScans()` which can be used to find the build scans emitted by Gradle builds and show them on the build page.

== Roadmap

* Using the Gradle API for accessing all the Gradle functionalities
* Providing a Maven-like or Ivy-like integration
** Multi-project detection
** Adding automatic tests result path detection
** Listing executed tasks with time execution for each task
** Providing a log for each module in a multi-project
